# Theorem JavaScript/TypeScript linting tool

This tool provides some benefits on top of eslint:

- **Setup**. Eslint out of the box does not support TypeScript or React, so this tool includes both if you need them;
- **Custom rules**. This includes code review patterns the team finds valuable. [The list](./src/rules);
- **Configuration**. At three levels of strictness, this allows to choose the correct set of rules prepared for you.

[Get started](./docs/setup.md).
